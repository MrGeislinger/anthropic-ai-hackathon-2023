      " Based on what's mentioned in the podcast, I believe the hosts don't spend a lot of time talking about flag design or expressing strong opinions on flag design. In fact, they appear to briefly mention flag design as an example in their discussion, but don't go into depth about it. At one point, Brady says \"as I'm looking at this, this monkey page, I have these three monkey pictures staring at me. He describes what the situation is with the monkeys. And then below, he says, it is a totally humbling and almost beyond my ability to write here experience.\" So they mention the monkey photos, but not the flag design itself. Overall, I don't think we can infer strong opinions on flag design from this podcast. The focus seems to lie elsewhere.\n"
